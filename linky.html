    <title>Mochi vs. Misu war</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p style="margin-top: 50px;"> I chose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_behavior">this</a> article because I'd like to learn more about cat behavior, specifically, cats' behavior toward other cats. You 
        see, I have a cat at home- the most adorable British shorthair/Scottish fold mix you've ever seen, his name is Mochi. One
        of the many things I love about him is that he is the most antisocial cat you'll ever meet, he hates other cats and only likes
        a handful of people. And my brother, also has an adorable British shorthair, her name is Misu (like Tiramisu, get it?). Now that
        my brother is doing summer research in a facility back in my hometown, he brought Misu along with him- to live in the same house
        Mochi for two months. Now, neither Mochi nor Misu have been too happy about this. So far, they hiss and growl at each other from
        across the room but don't dare approach. We're all anticipating World War III to break out sometime soon, and it'll be the cutest
        little battle in history. </p>

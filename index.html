    <h1>Hello, English 388</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Tamara Aboalsaud, I'm a senior studying Political Science at the University of Washington with a minor in English. 
      I am planning to graduate in the Spring and hope to pursue a career in screenplay writing afterwards. I grew up in Saudi Arabia
      surounded by a strong community of family and friends who taught me to value ambition and hard work, and I try to carry those 
      values with me in my job search and graduate school pursuit. The lessons I have learned at UW are ones I hope to carry with me 
      through this independent journey in the next few years of buidling the foundation of my career.
